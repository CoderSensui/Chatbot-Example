# Chatbot Example by Sensui

This is a simple chatbot example created by Me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot allows users to interact with it by typing messages and receiving responses from an external API Made By Me Too.

## Usage

You are free to use and modify this code for your projects. If you use this code or create a derivative work based on it, please acknowledge the original author by providing a link back to this repository or by mentioning "Chatbot Example by Sensui" in your project's documentation.

## Note about API Fetching

The chatbot fetches data from an external API. In some cases, you might encounter issues due to the same-origin policy. To address this, the code includes a CORS proxy URL (`https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`). If you face API fetching problems, you can try using the official CORS Anywhere service by accessing the following link:

[Official CORS Anywhere Service](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/)

You can replace the proxy URL in the code with the official CORS Anywhere service to ensure smooth API fetching.
